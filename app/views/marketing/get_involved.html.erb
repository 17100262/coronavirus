    Help Track The Virus In Your Community
  </h2>

  <p>Let's be honest. We're stuck with Covid-19 for the rest of the year, at least. As we all try to muddle through and hopefully start getting back to work over the summer, it's going to be crucial for everyone to understand if the virus is growing (or slowing) in their local community.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">The raw daily numbers that are currently being provided by the CDC, state health departments, and municipalities don't give us context around what the trajectory of the virus is where we live. National and global numbers aren't very useful to our daily lives. The national media is focused on the national numbers, but our country is huge, and local newspapers are too broke to spend time doing in-depth journalism. Help us fill in the gaps.</p>

  <h2 class="mb-2 mt-8 uppercase font-bold tracking-wider text-gray-400">
    Here's how you can help:

    Where to Find Good Data
  </h2>
  <p>I am checking the data on a daily basis for Nashville <a class="underline hover:text-orange-400" href="https://www.asafenashville.org">on a website</a> that the City of Nashville set up to manage their coronavirus response in Nashville. If you can't find a reliable source from your state or local government, then <a class="underline hover:text-orange-400" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">The NY Times county-by-county table</a> is a good source. They are not tracking these counties over time and sharing that data publicly, so that's where you step in. The key thing is to make sure to cite the source for your data and are transparent with date &amp; time you updated it.</p>
